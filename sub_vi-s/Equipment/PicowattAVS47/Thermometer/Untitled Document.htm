  <h1> Resistance Thermometry using GPIB Instruments</h1>
</center>

<h3>
<u>INTRODUCTION</u></h3>
<p>Although the data acquisition board that you have been using is a powerful 
  and versatile platform for measuring and generating electrical signals, sometimes 
  it is necessary or just more practical to use a piece of equipment designed 
  to perform a specific measurement. In such cases one often desires to transfer 
  the data from the instrument to the computer either for processing or storage. 
  The purpose of this lab is to gain some familiarity with controlling instruments 
  using a popular instrument-to-computer interface, the General Purpose Interface 
  Bus (or GPIB). The specialized measurement to be performed is resistance, which 
  can be done directly using the Keithley 2000 multimeter but not with the 6024E 
  DAQ board. The resistance that you will be measuring is that of a Resistance 
  Temperature Device (RTD) which is mounted on a heater. The goal is to monitor 
  the temperature of a heater as a function of time using a data acquisition VI. 
  Before you start working on this lab, read the section "The GPIB VIs" in chapter 
  11 of your text as a brief introduction to the GPIB interface. </p>
<h3><b><u>EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</u></b></h3>
<p>You will be using the model <a href="http://www.physics.udel.edu/%7Enowak/phys646/pdf/F3102_RTD.pdf">F3102</a> RTD from 
  Omega. This RTD is made from a thin film of platinum metal that has a nominal 
  resistance of 100 ohms at 0 deg C and ~ 110 Ohms at room temperature. Roughly 
  speaking, the resistance of platinum increases linearly with temperature from 
  30 K to 800 K; near room temperature the variation is approximately 0.385 Ohms 
  per degree Kelvin. The RTDs you'll be using are encased in a thin, flat ceramic 
  package that has a temperature rating of -50 up to 600 deg C (-60 to 1110 deg 
  F). Two RTDs are mounted on your the experimental setup using thermally conducting 
  adhesive; one is mounted on the heater (the gold-colored 10 Watt power resistor) 
  and the other is mounted on the underside of the black heat sink. </p>
<p>The file "<b><a href="http://www.physics.udel.edu/%7Enowak/phys646/F3102_rtd_cal.txt">F3102_rtd_cal.txt</a></b>" 
  contains the calibration table used to convert the measured resistance values 
  to temperatures. It consists of two tab-delimited columns. The first column 
  contains resistance values and the second has the corresponding temperatures. 
  There are 31 pairs of numbers spanning the temperature range from 0 to 300 deg 
  C. To download the file right click on the link and use "<i><b>Save Target 
  As . . .</b></i>" option to download the text file. Save the file in your 
  work folder.</p>
<p>The 2 position terminal connector block is used to provide power to the heater. 
  Connect it to a variable 10V @ 1 Amp power supply. <font color="#FF0000"><b>WARNING: 
  DO NOT DRIVE MORE THAN 1 AMP THROUGH THE HEATER.</b></font> The 8 position terminal 
  block will be used to measure the resistance of the RTDs. One RTD is connected 
  to the leftmost four positions, and the other RTD is connected to the rightmost 
  four positions. Unfortunately, there are two versions of the experimental set-up 
  that differ in the wiring configuration of this 8 position terminal block. Schematics 
  of both layouts are shown below. They are distinguished by the numbering of 
  the terminal positions.</p>

<h3><i>Two-lead versus four-lead</i></h3>
<p>The measurement of resistance sensors requires a current to be passed through 
  the RTD to produce a sensor voltage that can be measured.. The simplest resistance 
  measurement configuration is a current source connected to the RTD with a voltmeter 
  connect to the current leads as shown schematically in the figure below. The 
  current source can be represented as an ideal current source (Is) in parallel 
  with a shunt resistance, Rs. The voltmeter, normally a digital multimeter, can 
  be modeled as an ideal voltmeter (Vin) in parallel with an input impedance, 
  Rin.</p>
<p><img src="Untitled%20Document-Dateien/two_lead.JPG" height="173" width="585"></p>
<p>The dominant source of error in a two-lead resistance measurement is usually 
  the resistance of the lead wires connecting the current source to the RTD. Since 
  the leads to measure the voltage are also the current carrying leads, the resultant 
  voltage measured is the sum of the RTD voltage (Vs) and the IsR_lead voltage 
  drop in the leads. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Using the Keithley 2000 multimeter, measure the two-lead resistance between 
    the I+ and I- leads of the heater RTD. What temperature does this two-lead 
    resistance correspond to?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to eliminate the effects of lead resistance, a four-lead measurement 
  is normally used. Two of the leads, I+ and I-, supply current to the RTD, while 
  the two other leads, V+ and V-, are used to eliminate the effect of lead resistance 
  by measuring the voltage directly across the RTD leads. The reason this measurement 
  scheme works is that the IR drop in the current leads is not measured and the 
  voltage drop in the voltage leads is extremely small due to the very small current 
  required by the voltmeter (picoamperes or less) to make the voltage measurement. 
  This measurement configuration is illustrated below.</p>
<p><img src="Untitled%20Document-Dateien/four_lead.jpg" height="203" width="615"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure the multimeter to make a four-lead resistance measurement and 
    measure the resistance of the heater RTD again. Consult the multimeter manual 
    for wiring instructions. What temperature does this four-lead resistance correspond 
    to? Explain the difference in temperature readings.</li>
</ul>
<h3><i>GPIB and instrument drivers</i></h3>
<p>Now that we have a precision method for measuring the resistance we are ready 
  to take measurements and transfer the data to the computer using LabVIEW VIs. 
  Initially you will completely rely on VIs that have been written by someone 
  else, Instrument Drivers. You can manipulate the output of those VIs, numbers 
  or arrays, without knowing anything about GPIB or the commands that have to 
  be sent to the instrument to make it work. You may find this unsatisfactory, 
  but it emphasizes one of the main messages of the lab course -- for most simple 
  problems, LabVIEW has the solution already built in or it is somewhere ready 
  to be downloaded. </p>
<p>You will find that there is already a GPIB interface card inside your computer, 
  and LabVIEW GPIB software has already been installed. However, the drivers for 
  the individual instruments are not yet installed. You will need the driver for 
  the Keithley 2000 multimeter. You can download this driver from the National 
  Instruments web site. 
</p><p>Use a web Browser to go to the National Instruments site&nbsp; <a href="http://zone.ni.com/idnet">http://zone.ni.com/idnet</a> . Select "downloads", 
  and download the <i>Plug-and-play</i> drivers for the Keithley 2000 multimeter.&nbsp; 
  Use the <b>C:\TEMP</b> directory for temporary storage. You will find that you 
  now have obtained a compressed file. Clicking on it will launch the Winzip facility. 
  Select "Extract" and make sure you unzip all files belonging to one driver simultaneously. 
  The drivers are placed in separate folders for each instrument. Place these 
  folders in the <b>C:\---\instr.lib</b> directory on your computer. 
</p><h3> <i>Testing the connection</i></h3>
Now that you have your drivers, you can connect your hardware, and install the 
drivers. Connecting the hardware is just a matter of connecting IEEE cables between 
your computer and the multimeter. You can use NIMAX to detect your instruments.&nbsp; 
After installation you should find the driver as VI in the function pallet under 
<b>Instrument I/O / Instrument Drivers</b>. If not, check that you have put your 
drivers in the appropriate directory. To get familiar with the driver VI, try 
to run it on its own first. For example, use <b>Keithley 2000 Single Read.vi.</b>. 
<h3><u>WRITING YOUR OWN INSTRUMENT CONTROL VIs</u></h3>
You may have noticed that typical instrument drivers are quite complicated VIs 
having many options and performing a wide range of tasks. Often, after an instrument 
is properly configured, you want to do only one thing and repeat this over and 
over again. For example, if you want to monitor a resistance as a function of 
time, it is sufficient to configure a multimeter as a resistance meter once, and 
then periodically ask the multimeter for the current value. In the following you 
are asked to write a few basic VIs to read and write to the Keithley multimeter. 
<br>
&nbsp; 
<blockquote>A) Write a sub-VI that writes a command to an instrument on the GPIB 
  bus, and reads back the response. Use the <b>GPIB write </b>and <b>GPIB read</b> 
  VIs on the Function panel. Your VI should have as inputs (controls) the bus 
  address of the instrument and the control string, and as output (indicator) 
  the response string. Also give the sub-VI an error in and an error out terminal. 
  Save this VI. 
        <p>B) Write a sub-VI that reads the Keithley multimeter, using the previously 
          developed write/read sub-VI. Use as command string READ? to get the 
          Keithley to talk. Convert the response from a string to a number. This 
          VI should have as input the bus address of the multimeter, and as output 
          the multimeter reading. Of course it should also have an error in and 
          an error out terminal. <br>
    &nbsp; 
  </p><p>C) Write a VI that, in combination with the Keithley multimeter, can be used 
    to determine the four-lead resistance value of a RTD. To do this, have the 
    VI first configure the Keithley as four-lead resistance meter and then read 
    the resistance. <i><b>You will find information about the commands to configure 
    the Keithley in section 5-3 of the user manual.</b></i> On first reading do 
    not attempt to completely understand the information provided! 
  </p><p>D) Once the resistance is translated into a numeric value in LabVIEW it can 
    be converted to a temperature. In some instances, a RTD's calibration table 
    can be fit using a polynomial so that the temperature, T, can be computed; 
    for example T = a + bR + cR^2 + dR^3 + eR^4 + . . ., where a, b, c, d, and 
    e are the coefficients and R is the measured resistance. An alternative conversion 
    can be done using linear interpolation between {resistance, temperature} pairs 
    of points. This method is illustrated below and uses a built-in linear interpolation 
    VI. 
  </p><p><img src="Untitled%20Document-Dateien/interpolation.jpg" height="571" width="594">
  </p><p>Write a VI that will monitor the temperature of the heater as a function 
    of time. The VI should configure the Keithley 2000 multimeter to measure the 
    RTD's resistance using the four-lead method and convert the resistance to 
    a temperature using linear interpolation. The data should be graphed and saved 
    to a file in a manner similar to that in the previous lab (Simple Fluid Mechanics 
    using Transducers).
  </p><p>Explore answers to the following questions. Investigate how the temperature 
    of the heater increases by applying approximately 0.5 Amps to the heater. 
    <font color="#FF0000"><b>WARNING: DO NOT DRIVE MORE THAN 1 AMP THROUGH THE 
    HEATER.</b></font> Do the heating and cooling curves look similar? Upon heating, 
    how long does it take for the temperature to stabilize? What is the final 
    temperature? How would you describe the mathematical form of the temperature 
    dependence? What are two primary factors that set the time scale at which 
    the heater reaches it final 'equilibrium' temperature? How is the final temperature 
    and time dependence affected if thermally conductive paste is used to enhance 
    heat conduction between the heater and the large metallic heat sink? <font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE: 
    WHEN HANDLING THE HEATER BE SURE NOT TO EXERT EXCESSIVE TORQUE ON THE BOLTS 
    - THEY ARE EASILY STRIPPED! ALSO, THE HEATER CAN GET VERY HOT, BE CAREFUL 
    NOT TO BURN YOURSELF.</b></font>
